/// Two ways in, both resolved by the hook:
///
/// - **Automatic** (the default): keyed off the voice id's first character, as it always was.
/// - **Override**: the `tts_persona` pref (or `OW_TTS_PERSONA`) names a persona by `id`,
///   decoupling character from voice. The accent still comes from the voice — the nudge
///   already names accent and persona in separate clauses, so "a French accent, adopt a
///   Japanese persona" reads as intended rather than as a contradiction.
///
/// This is the **display and resolution** half. The hook is still the only thing that steers
/// the model; nothing here is read at nudge time.
/// `HookTests.voicePersonaParityFailures()` parses `resolve_flavor()` and fails if the two
/// drift, the same guarantee `VoiceLanguageParityChecks` gives the language map.
